While preparing this book, we received extraordinary support and help
from many people, and we are deeply thankful to all of them. First
of all, we would like to thank those who were directly involved in the
underlying research and software development. Craig Kolb wrote the
ray tracer rayshade used to render many of the images included in
the book. Allan Snider developed several software tools, including a
previewer for rayshade, and provided valuable expertise in ray-tracing.
Daryl Hepting developed software for rendering sets defined by iterated
function systems and provided diagrams for Chapter 8. Norma Fuller
modeled several man-made objects incorporated into the images.
We would like to thank Zdzis? law Pawlak and Grzegorz Rozenberg
who initiated the contact between the Theoretical Biology Group at
the University of Utrecht and the Computer Graphics Group at the
University of Regina. Benoit Mandelbrot and Heinz-Otto Peitgen made
it possible to conduct parts of the reported research at Yale University
and the University of Bremen.
We are also grateful to all those who shared their knowledge with
us and made suggestions reflected in this book. Discussions and corre-
spondence with Jules Bloomenthal, Mark de Does, Pauline Hogeweg,
Jacqueline and Hermann Lück, Gavin Miller, Laurie Reuter, Dietmar
Saupe and Alvy Ray Smith were particularly fruitful.
Research reported in this book was funded by grants from the Nat-
ural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, as well as
an equipment donation and a research grant from Apple Computer,
Inc. We are particularly grateful to Mark Cutter for making the sup-
port from Apple possible. The Graphics Laboratory at the University
of Regina also enjoys continued support from the university. The influ-
ence of Lawrence Symes and R. Brien Maguire is deeply appreciated.
In addition, the University of Regina and the University of Utrecht
contributed towards travel expenses.
We would like to thank Springer-Verlag and in particular, Gerhard
Rossbach and Nina LaVoy from the Springer West Coast Office, for the
expedient publishing of this book.
Finally, we would like to thank our families and friends for their
love, support and patience while we worked on this book.
